The goal of the Django Map Widgets package is to create user-friendly UI widgets for GeoDjango form fields that are
highly configurable.

Currently, the package supports Google, Mapbox, and Leaflet map providers. If you would like to see support for
additional providers and believe you can contribute, feel free to do so. We would be happy to review and merge your
contributions.
