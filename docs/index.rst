Django Map Widgets Documentation
================================

Django Map Widgets is a package that provides highly configurable, pluggable, and user-friendly map widgets for
GeoDjango form fields. It simplifies the integration of interactive maps into GeoDjango applications, enhancing the
overall development experience.

The primary goal of Django Map Widgets is to bridge the gap between powerful GeoDjango functionality and user-friendly
map interactions, creating a more accessible and enjoyable experience for both developers and end-users of
GeoDjango-powered applications.
